    "Sparkle World is a mobile-first, whimsical React + TypeScript PWA for a 12-year-old audience, designed as a private 'digital grimoire'.",
    "It is strictly local-first: no backend, no accounts, no tracking, and uses Dexie (IndexedDB) for persistence.",
    "The app follows a plugin-like 'Realm' system driven by a central registry; shared state is provided via a React Context ('Magic Bridge').",
    "Key features include Home (trophy room, owl prophecy, easter-egg hotspots, dragon egg hatch), Media (Archive.org discovery plus YouTube embeds and rewards), Diary (emoji-derived key encryption using Web Crypto and optional voice input), plus future Games and Crafts modules."

  "open_questions": [
    "Where are the referenced handover UI components (ArchWindow.tsx and Shelf.tsx) and the asset pack under public/ui/, and what are the canonical filenames?",
    "What is the minimum supported browser set for V1 (especially for SpeechRecognition support and iOS constraints)?",
    "What is the expected offline UX for Archive.org searches and YouTube embeds, and do we cache any metadata locally?",
    "What are the initial local JSON contents for prophecies and riddles (quantity, tone boundaries, any banned themes)?",
    "What is the initial Dexie schema versioning and migration approach for future changes (upgrade paths versus reset)?"
